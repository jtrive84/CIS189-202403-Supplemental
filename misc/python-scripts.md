In Python, every script or module can be executed as either the main program or 
imported as a module into another program. 

Hereâ€™s how if `__name__ == "__main__"` works:

Module vs. Script Execution:

When you write a Python script and execute it directly with `python script.py`, Python sets a special built-in variable called `__name__` to `"__main__"`.

When a script is imported as a module into another script or interactive session, Python sets `__name__` to the name of the module (e.g., "module_name").

Purpose of if `__name__ == "__main__"`:


This construct allows you to differentiate between when your script is being run directly versus when it is being imported elsewhere.
Code within the if `__name__ == "__main__"` block will only run if the script is executed directly.


Why Use It?:

Modularity: It helps in keeping your code modular. Functions and classes defined in the script can be imported and reused in other scripts without running the main block.
Testing: You can include test code or examples in the if __name__ == "__main__" block to test your module's functionality when run as a script.


Use if `__name__ == "__main__"`: to provide a script-level entry point, often calling a `main()` function where the main logic of the script resides.

This pattern is particularly useful for scripts that are designed to be both reusable as modules and executable as standalone programs.


Benefits:

Clarity: Clearly separates code intended for script execution from code intended for module import.
Avoids Unintended Execution: Prevents unintended execution of code when importing modules into other scripts.
